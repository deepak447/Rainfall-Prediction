# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict rainfall in Sydney, Australia using historical weather data and various classification models. It was developed as a course project for Internshala Trainings' Data Science PGC program, simulating a real-world scenario for "The Daily Buzz" newspaper.

## Project Overview

"The Daily Buzz" wants to improve the accuracy of their "Weather Oracle" column by leveraging machine learning.  This project addresses this need by building and evaluating several classification models, including Decision Trees, Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forest, to predict rainfall (RainTomorrow).  The goal is to identify the model with the highest accuracy and provide recommendations for further improvement.

## Dataset

The project uses a weather dataset from 2008 to 2017, containing various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, cloud cover, and rainfall etc.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The project begins with loading the data and performing necessary preprocessing steps. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical features, and potentially scaling numerical features.
 **Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Understanding:**
  - Begin by thoroughly understanding the provided rainfall dataset, including its structure, columns, and the meaning of each variable. Gain insights into the data's distribution, summary statistics, and potential outliers.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handle Missing Values: Identify and address missing data by imputation or removal, ensuring that data is complete.
  - Outlier Detection and Treatment: Detect and handle outliers in the dataset, which could impact the model's accuracy.
  - Convert Categorical Data: Transform categorical variables (e.g., "Location" and "Month") into numerical format.
  - Feature Selection: Use statistical techniques such as correlation analysis to select the most relevant features for rainfall prediction.
 
 **Model Selection:**
    - Choose different classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to build and evaluate the predictive models.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the models and assess their performance.
    - Use appropriate evaluation metrics like Accuracy and F1-score to measure the model's accuracy.
    - Experiment with different hyperparameters for each model and use cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

- **Model Comparison:**
    - Compare the performance of different models and select the one with the best accuracy and generalization.

- **Further Improvement:**
    - Consider additional techniques for model improvement, such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**  Several classification models are trained and evaluated using the preprocessed data:
    - **Logistic regression:** A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model the probability of an event occurring.
    - **K-nearest neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric model that classifies new data points based on the majority vote of their k nearest neighbors in the training data.
    - **Decision trees:** A tree-like structure that represents a series of decisions that are used to classify new data points.
    - **Random forests:** An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
    - **Gradient boosting machines:** An ensemble model that combines multiple weak learners to improve accuracy.
    - **Gaussian naive Bayes:** A probabilistic model that assumes that the features of the data are normally distributed.
    - **Multinomial naive Bayes:** A probabilistic model that assumes that the features of the data are multinomially distributed.
    - **Binomial naive Bayes:** A probabilistic model that assumes that the features of the data are binomially distributed.

3. **Model Selection:** The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and visualized using confusion matrices. The model with the highest accuracy is selected as the best performing model.

4. **Performance Analysis and Improvement Suggestions:**  The reasons behind the superior performance of the chosen model are analyzed.  Potential strategies for further enhancing the model's accuracy are also discussed.
